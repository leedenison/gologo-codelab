*After a while the kid realised that at this rate it would take a long time to get out of the maze.  {{< capHe >}} needed a better plan.  It was time to get serious.  {{< capHe >}} reached out with {{< his >}} left hand and leant against the wall of the maze.  Suddenly {{< he >}} looked at {{< his >}} hand touching the wall.  {{< capHe >}} had an idea.*

Walking around the maze at random will eventually find the exit, but it could take a long time.  We can do better.

{{< notice red >}}Delete the lines of code in your <strong>GetMoves</strong> function so that we can try a different approach!{{< /notice >}}

Imagine we are stood in the maze.  If we reach out and touch the wall of the maze to our left hand.  We can walk around the maze trailing our hand along the stone and we would never need to take our hand off the wall.  If we came to a doorway on our left we would turn the corner like this:

![left-turn](/images/left-turn.png)

If the doorway was on the right we would ignore it like this:

![straight-on](/images/straight-on.png)

If the corridor turned back on itself, we have to think about how to keep our hand on the wall.  We would have to turn all the way round like this:

![u-turn](/images/u-turn.png) 

The same as before we have to figure out what exactly we want the program to do, and then break it down into small steps.
